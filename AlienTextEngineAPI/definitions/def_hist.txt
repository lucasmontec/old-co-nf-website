In this engine a history is a model that contain information about a situation.
Histories contain the ambients and things that can happen in them given a players action.
The TaleDriver runs this model (and any implementations of it).
A history is not an entire game, but most of it.
This is better explained design-wise like this:
<br><br>
A game:<br>
A game in this engine is the set of objects, rooms, player states, triggers
and all avaliable assets that create its universe. Things that exist.
<br><br>
A history:<br>
A history in this engine is ambient that exists in a game universe.
It uses the game assets to create a narrative around scenes adding things
that can happen, characters and avaliable interactions. Imagine it as a binder
that links player interaction to a bunch of possible outcomes.
