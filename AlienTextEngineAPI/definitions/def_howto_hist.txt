To make a history you can either use java or TaleCode. Since tale code isn't avaliable
yet, lets talk about java.

In java, creating a history can be pretty straight forward. You can either make a subclass
of the History class to implement your own history model or you can instantiate one of the
avaliable history models to fill them with stuff.
<br>
I recommend the latter one so lets talk about it. Later I'll add information about the first
(the examples depict the first method also).
To instantiate a history model just pick one of the models (currently a graph and a matrix model
are avaliable) and do a normal instantiation. Like this:
<br><br>
<center><code class="language-java">MatrixHistory history = new MatrixHistory("A history name", "A author name", 5, 5);</code></center>
<br>
A matrix history comes with a internal matrix of scenes. In this example we created the instance with
a 5x5 matrix (width x height).
